# Youtopia
created this app with a neighboorhood centric focus
to enable residents to transact and interact with each 
other. 
A way to build community, find resources, join groups
and just have fun
Also a way to communicate and address issues within the community 
as well as with management.
The goal for me personally was to develop 
software architecting skill using REST and
object oriented design principles.
I am the sole developer on this project.
At the time I was planning to take it further,
Facebook was looking to launch something similar.
I did not think I stood a chance. Not sure 
what happened to the Facebook idea, but another
similar app has since been on the market.
It was a great learning experience and fun
stuff too!!!
